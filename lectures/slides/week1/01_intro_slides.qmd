**Skills**

- Critical evaluation of scientific evidence, data and theory
- Develop independent thinking skills
- Appreciate how understanding neurodiversity impacts basic research and society in general

## Learning Outcomes ## {.smaller}

::: {.incremental}
-   To examine critically how neuroscientific concepts, theories, and findings relate to broader historical, moral, and social contexts, enhancing reflective competencies.

-   To question the production and validation of scientific evidence within the context of the replication crisis, enabling students to evaluate how knowledge is created, validated, and communicated.

-   To understand how conceptualising cognitive variation as a natural continuum challenges deficit-focused models, promoting more inclusive frameworks for society.

-   To develop effective communication skills for translating complex scientific concepts to diverse audiences, fostering public understanding of science.
:::

## Format ## {.smaller}

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
- Lectures will be split into two sections with a short break in the middle. 

<br>

- I will present material in the first half. 

<br>

- In the second half, students will break into small groups and have time to read and discuss relevant papers from that week’s material.

## Small group work ## {.smaller}

- Students have the opportunity to discuss any questions arising from the previous lecture, as well as coursework. 

- A journal article will be provided from the previous lecture as a starting point for this discussion.

- Group discussion sessions are an excellent way to clarify understanding and develop ideas for your assignment.

## Topics ## 

- Introduction
- Crisis and reform
- Social neuroscience
- Neurodiversity
- Essay writing Q&A

# Part 1 - Assessment #

## Assessment type ##

- There is one piece of assessment in this course, which is a written assignment in essay format.

- 2000 words maximum.

- Submission date: Monday January 6th, 2026.

- **There is NO exam**

- Just email me the file. If I do not write back to you with confirmation within a few days, then email me again.

## Assessment format ##

You can write your essay in two different ways.

**1. Address a general question.**

e.g., Is psychology a science or a pseudoscience?

**2. Address a more specific question.**

e.g., Should Autism be considered one diagnosis or multiple different diagnoses?

**You decide the focus of your essay based on what you find interesting.**

## Assessment structure ##

Example structure (it seems obvious, but nonetheless…):

- Introduction
- Main body of the essay
- Conclusion

## Assessment content ## {.smaller}

Things to cover:

- Identify an open research question, which warrants further attention
- Provide a brief background to the topic
- Highlight a gap in knowledge (what we do not know)
- Be critical 
- Identify a novel research question or research direction
- State your hypotheses and/or aims
- Discuss the implications of the research (why is it worth doing?) 

# Part 1 - Writing tips #

## Narrow focus ##

- Your essay should have a narrow focus, I do not want a detailed literature review. 

- You are not being assessed on the breadth of your knowledge. Therefore, I will not mark you down for having a narrow focus.

- However, I expect a very clear and well-supported rationale for your critical viewpoint and future direction.

- I will reward attempts to think on your own

## Keep it simple !!! ##

- Find an experiment or topic from my lectures that interests you
- Go away and read around the topic 
- Think of a feature that limits understanding – i.e., be critical – and suggest a way to extend current knowledge

## Plan, plan and plan some more ##

- Plan your written assignment BEFORE you start to write. You will find it easier to write if you organise your ideas first into a structure. 

- Consider the balance of your assignment, in terms of the amount of text per section.

- Make multiple plans, rather than one. One page A4 per plan.

- Review the plans and consider revision and/or consolidation.

## Writing style ##

- Clarity is crucial 
- If you can say it with less words, do so (i.e., keep sentences short).
- Try to link paragraphs to promote the flow and pace of your writing 
- Have a friend or classmate read it

# Part 1 - Reflective writing #

## Week 5 ##

- In week 5, there is no lecture.
- Instead, there is an assignment, which is **NOT** marked.
- I repeat, it is **not marked**, but it is compulsory to hand it in via email by ***Monday October 20th at 9am***.
- Please write between 500 and 750 words on the extent to which the reproducibility crisis extends beyond psychology and human neuroscience.

## Reflective writing objectives ## {.smaller}

<br>

- I would like you to reflect on the extent to which the reproducibility crisis extends beyond psychology and human neuroscience.

- Most of you have varied backgrounds, which span computer science, physics, chemistry, biology, maths etc.

- Therefore, I would like you to situate what you have learnt in the last 4 weeks within a broader context of scientific research more generally. 

# Part 1 - Summary #

- Introduction

# Take a break #


# Part 2 - Read articles and discuss #

## Discussion material ##

- Here are some accessible (i.e., non-technical) blog posts that cover the main themes in the course.
- Read these to kick-start a discussion in your group.
