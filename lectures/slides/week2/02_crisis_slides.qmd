- Attempted to replicate 100 experiments from 3 leading Psychology journals.
- contacted original authors for materials and hypotheses.
- pre-registered analysis plans.
- high power designs (e.g., much larger samples than the originals).

>The human understanding when it has once adopted an opinion … draws all else to support and agree with it.

Francis Bacon, 1620

## Bias ##

- Positive and new trumps the negative but true (“A beautiful story undone by an ugly truth”)

- An extreme version: Daryl Bem and “precognition” – 2011.

## Bias ##

<br>

- Publication bias (or the “file-drawer effect”).

- Studies that fail to show a statistically significant effects, or that reproduce the work of others, have such low priority that they are effectively censored from the scientific record.

- They either end up in the file-drawer or never get conducted in the first place.

## Bias ## {.incremental}

- Confirmation bias - we see what we expect and only check when there are deviations

- The scientific literature is dominated by results that confirm hypotheses, rather than fail to confirm.

- An arms-race has started to show new and “sexy” results, which confirm hypotheses, but ultimately bias the published literature.

## Hidden Flexibility ##

- p-hacking
- Peculiar patterns of p
- Ghost hunting (or lack of high-quality replication)
- Biased debugging
  - If the results turn out as expected, do no further checks. If the results are a surprise, then check the code for bugs.
  
## Unreliability ##

>And it’s this type of integrity, this kind of care not to fool yourself, that is missing to a large extent in much of the research in cargo cult science.

Richard Feynman, 1974

## Unreliability ## {.smaller}


- Was Einstein wrong?
  - Particles break light-speed limit … September 2011

<br>

::: {.incremental}
- Answer…. No.
- By June 2012, three independent teams had failed to replicate the original result. Neutrinos intheir experiments travelled at approximately the speed of light.

- One month later, the original team reported that their findings were caused by a loose fibre-optic cable!!
- But this is just what should happen in a good scientific environment, where human error will certainly happen.
:::

## Unreliability ##

- Sources:
  - disregard of direct replication
  - lack of power
  - failure to disclose methods
  - statistical fallacies
  - failure to retract

## Data hoarding ##

>Code and data or it didn’t happen.

## Data hoarding ##

<br>

- A story from my first paper submission (many years ago…).
- Failure to share
- Secret sharing 
- Failure to share hides misconduct

## Corruptibility ##

- Science Fictions is another entertaining read
- It emphasizes that Fraud, Bias, Hype and Questionable Research Practices are not restricted to Psychological research.
- In fact, it is common in medical research and the drivers are largely the same 
- This might be surprising given the consequences of medical research

>Publish means “make public.”

Mike Taylor, 2012
:::
::::

## Internment ## {.smaller}

- Not only are data not publicly avaiable (as we discussed earlier), but the article and conclusions are normally kept behind a paywall.

- This is morally questionable, given that the vast majority of research across the world is funded by the public via taxes.

- Univeristy libraries tend to have access via a subscription (so academics can read papers), but the general public do not.

## Internment ##

<br>

- Why do Psychologists support barrier-based publishing?

  - Prestige associated with barrier-based journals

  - Incentives to publish in key journals for career progression

  - There was no real alternative (historically)

## Bean counting ##

>Not everything that counts can be counted, and not everything that can be counted counts.

## Bean counting ## {.smaller}

Can science measure itself?

- Metrics are used to measure the “quality” of science and scientists e.g., impact factor of a journal, grant capture, number of papers published, author position, number of citations.

- So folks shoot for these by trying to game the system in anyway they can, which tends to encourage poor research rather than better research.

- **Goodhart’s law:** when a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.

## Discussion material ##

<br>

- break into small groups (~ 5 per group)
- discuss aspects of the lecture – 7 deadly sins
- discuss aspects of the journal article:
<https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.aac4716>
- can you think of any solutions?
