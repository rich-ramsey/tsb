# Part 1 - Essay writing: assessment details #

## Assessment type ##

- There is one piece of assessment in this course, which is a written assignment in essay format.

- 2000 words maximum.

- Submission date: Monday January 6th, 2026.

- **There is NO exam**

- Just email me the file. If I do not write back to you with confirmation within a few days, then email me again.

## Assessment format ##

You can write your essay in two different ways.

**1.** Address a general question.

e.g., Is psychology a science or a pseudoscience?

**2.** Address a more specific question.

e.g., Should Autism be considered one diagnosis or multiple different diagnoses?

## Assessment structure ##

Example structure (it seems obvious, but nonetheless…):

- Introduction
- Main body of the essay
- Conclusion

## Assessment content ## {.smaller}

Things to cover:

- Identify an open research question, which warrants further attention
- Provide a brief background to the topic
- Highlight a gap in knowledge (what we do not know)
- Be critical 
- Identify a novel research question or research direction
- State your hypotheses and/or aims
- Discuss the implications of the research (why is it worth doing?) 

## Assessment criteria ## {.smaller}

**Threshold** 

- Adequate understanding of the material is demonstrated, which is largely based on information provided within lectures. 

**Good**

- Generally accurate coverage of relevant material, which shows evidence of independent thought that extends lecture materials. Well organised and structured. 

**Excellent**

- Consistently accurate coverage of relevant material, which shows a depth of independent thought that comprehensively extends lecture materials. Well organised and structured with a clear and efficient writing style.


# Part 1 - Essay writing: tips and style guide #

## Narrow focus ##

- Your essay should have a narrow focus, I do not want a detailed literature review. 

- You are not being assessed on the breadth of your knowledge. Therefore, I will not mark you down for having a narrow focus.

- However, I expect a very clear and well-supported rationale for your critical viewpoint and future direction.

- I will reward attempts to think on your own.

## Keep it simple !!! ##

- Find an experiment or topic from my lectures that interests you
- Go away and read around the topic 
- Think of a feature that limits understanding – i.e., be critical – and suggest a way to extend current knowledge

## Plan, plan and plan some more ##

- Plan your written assignment BEFORE you start to write. You will find it easier to write if you organise your ideas first into a structure. 

- Consider the balance of your assignment, in terms of the amount of text per section.

- Make multiple plans, rather than one. One page A4 per plan.

- Review the plans and consider revision and/or consolidation.

## Writing style ##

- Clarity is crucial 
- If you can say it with less words, do so (i.e., keep sentences short).
- Try to link paragraphs to promote the flow and pace of your writing.
- Have a friend or classmate read it.


# Take a break #


# Part 2 - Read articles and discuss #

## Discussion material ##

Discuss essay writing:

- See the resources on course website.
- Do some of your own research on what makes a good essay.
- Consider the structure and content of your essays.
- Then let’s discuss as a group.
