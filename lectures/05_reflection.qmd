## Objectives

I would like you to reflect on the extent to which the reproducibility crisis extends beyond psychology and human neuroscience.

Most of you have varied backgrounds, which span computer science, physics, chemistry, biology, maths etc.

Therefore, I would like you to situate what you have learnt in the last 4 weeks within a broader context of scientific research more generally. 

See below for details of the assignment.
